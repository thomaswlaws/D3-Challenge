An interactive D3 scatterplot using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2014 ACS 1-year estimates (https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. The final interactive scatterplot is located at https://tinytom118.github.io/D3-Challenge/.

This interactive scatterplot uses the D3.js library to create the scatterplot and make it interactive with the user. By clicking on each variable along the x or y axis, the user can change the variables under comparison. D3 allows the transition to a new scatterplot to occur and the d3-tips library is also used to add tooltips to each state bubble along with the appropriate metric.
